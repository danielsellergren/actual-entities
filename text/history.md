# A Quick History of Actual Entities

Actual Entities are the fundamental elements of reality in the philosophy of English-American mathematician and logician, [Alfred North Whitehead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead). His philosophical worldview is known as [Process Philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy) and is based on the ideas of change and development.

## Whitehead&rsquo;s Work

Whitehead is best known for his philosophical treatise [Process and Reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_and_Reality), and for coauthoring with Bertrand Russell the magnificent [Principia Mathematica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica) which is considered by many to be the seminal work of modern symbolic logic.

In *Process and Reality*, Whitehead proposed that the universe is populated entirely by Actual Entities (AEs), Eternal Objects (EOs), and a principal object known as God. In this philosophical master work, all things are occasions of existence or "moments" and the process by which they change is the creative act of becoming.

## Actual Entities

According to Whitehead, the universe does not consist of substances, but rather an abundance of processes which consist of "moments" or "occasions". These "occasions" are the actual entities themselves. Along with the AEs, the universe also consists of two other types known as Eternal Objects (EOs) and a non-temporal being termed God.

"An actual entity is a process of growth from phase to phase ending in a definite achievement." [Hooper]

The growth from phase to phase is called "concrescence" with the final result being termed "concretion".

Additionally, actual entities are not everyday objects. Neither the books on your shelf, nor the people in your life are individual actual entities. Instead, picture yourself and everyone else as great "societies" of actual entities. A multitude of actual entities working as atomic elements, but also part of a functional whole. A single actual entity is much closer to a quantum vibration than an organism.
 
These occasions have a direction, which can be thought of as succession in most cases. In other words, occasions or entities follow from previous occasions according to certain rules.

So how are Actual Entities created? Each Actual Entity is a creative act, that looks at every other object in the universe and then builds a new and unique reflection of the universe. This reflection of the immediate settled state of the universe is itself the Actual Entity.
