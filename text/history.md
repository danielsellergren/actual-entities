# A Quick History of Actual Entities

Actual Entities are the fundamental elements of reality in the philosophy of English-American mathematician and logician, [Alfred North Whitehead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead).

## Whitehead&rsquo;s Work

Whitehead is best known for his philosophical treatise [Process and Reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_and_Reality), and for coauthoring the magnificent [Principia Mathematica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica) with Bertrand Russell.

In *Process and Reality*, Whitehead proposed that the universe is populated entirely by Actual Entities, Eternal Objects, and a principal object known as God.

## Actual Entities

Actual Entities are also known as "occasions" because they are closer to moments than actual beings. These occasions have a direction, which can be thought of as succession in most cases. In other words, occasions or entities follow from previous occasions according to certain rules.

So how are Actual Entities created? Each Actual Entity is a creative act, that looks at every other object in the universe and then builds a new and unique reflection of the universe. This reflection of the immediate settled state of the universe is itself the Actual Entity.
